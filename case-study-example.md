# Case Study: Resolving Signal Loss in Microwave Backhaul

## Scenario
A regional telecom site reported intermittent signal loss affecting microwave backhaul links. The issue disrupted voice and data services across multiple sectors.

## Diagnostic Steps
- Verified grounding and power continuity.
- Used spectrum analyzer to detect RF interference.
- Inspected antenna alignment and cabling.
- Cross-checked SONET link status and fiber integrity.

## Resolution
- Identified loose grounding strap causing intermittent signal degradation.
- Re-secured grounding and replaced corroded connectors.
- Coordinated with vendor for firmware update on affected transceivers.
- Restored full service and documented resolution steps.

## Outcome
Service was restored within 6 hours. Documentation was shared with field teams and added to the troubleshooting knowledge base. Preventive maintenance protocols were updated to include grounding strap inspections.
