# Case Study: Resolving Fiber Optic Signal Degradation

## Scenario
A metro telecom hub reported degraded signal quality on a DWDM fiber link, impacting customer data throughput.

## Diagnostic Steps
- Verified power supply and UPS status.
- Inspected fiber connectors for dust and damage.
- Ran OTDR (Optical Time Domain Reflectometer) test to locate attenuation points.
- Checked SONET equipment logs for error counts.

## Resolution
- Identified contaminated fiber connectors causing signal loss.
- Cleaned and replaced connectors with proper dust caps.
- Coordinated with vendor to recalibrate DWDM multiplexers.
- Restored full throughput and documented preventive measures.

## Outcome
Service was restored within 4 hours. Lessons learned were added to the troubleshooting guide, emphasizing regular fiber inspection and connector cleaning protocols.
